Monty Hall Problem

A game show host tells you to choose 1 of 3 doors.

behind 2 doors is a goat.

Behind the winning door is a car.

The player chooses 1 door.

The program will than open one of the other doors that has a goat behind it. 
	(make sure it can not open the door with the car)

The player now has the option to stay with their initial choice, or switch to the other closed door.

Using any program you prefer create this game.  Make it replayable. 
 And have it display how many times the player has switch, or stayed and how many times they have won in each case.
